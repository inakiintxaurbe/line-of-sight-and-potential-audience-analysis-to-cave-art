This repository contains the scripts and results from https://doi.org/10.1007/s10816-022-09552-y.
The 3D of the caves could not be included, due to their size. However, the scripts work 
with .wrl files, which must be named following the instructions published in the Supplementary Materials.

The scripts can be edited by other researchers, according to their interests and problems. 
The results originated using this script can also be shared in this repository.
